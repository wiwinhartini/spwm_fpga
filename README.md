# Sine Pulse Wave Modulation FPGA Project

I implemented this PWM code for my MS thesis project under the advisory of Professor Mahima Gupta.

## Setup

This HDL project was run on a [zedboard](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/1-8dyf-11.html). You can add it to a Vivado IDE project to run it.
